# Introductory mathematics in R and Python  

This repository contains a series of tutorials designed to help R users explore introductory mathematical concepts (algebra, matrices, calculus and probability).  


## Aim:  

The **primary aim** of this repository is to **provide beginner friendly mathematics tutorials** for users who are interested in understanding machine learning algorithms (also known as statistical programming) but do not come from a mathematics background/ have forgotten all their high school or undergraduate mathematics studies.  

This repository also has a **secondary aim** of **promoting code agnostic practices**, by highlighting how **the same functions can be performed in both R and Python**.  


## Authors:  
Dr Erika Duan (for the tutorials)  
Dr Chuanxin Liu (for fixing my occasional coding bugs)
