# Introductory mathematics in R and Python  

This repository contains a series of tutorials designed to help R users explore introductory mathematical concepts (algebra, matrices, calculus and probability).  


## Aim:  

The aim of this repository is to provide resources to help users who are interested in practicing machine learning but do not come from a mathematics background/ have forgotten all their specialist mathematics knowledge.  

This repository also has a secondary aim of **promoting code agnostic practices**, by highlighting how the same functions can be performed in both R and Python.  


## Authors:  
Dr Erika Duan (for the tutorials)  
Dr Chuanxin Liu (for fixing my occasional coding bugs)
